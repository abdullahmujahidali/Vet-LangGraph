            "Based on this information, let's develop a case theory:\n",
            "\n",
            "### Unified Case Theory:\n",
            "Jax Miracle, a 4-year-old male Pomeranian, presents with a persistent dry cough, hacking, and loud panting. The absence of vomiting, normal feces, drinking, urination, and appetite suggests a primarily respiratory issue. The reported anxiety may exacerbate the symptoms. The combination of various foods and medications could potentially contribute to or mask underlying conditions. The lack of travel history outside the Kentucky/Southern IN region reduces the likelihood of exposure to certain infectious agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommended Next Steps:\n",
            "1. **Respiratory Workup:** Conduct a thorough respiratory workup to investigate the underlying cause of the cough, including chest X-rays, tracheal wash, and possibly bronchoscopy.\n",
            "2. **Anxiety Management:** Address Jax Miracle's anxiety to potentially alleviate stress-related exacerbation of symptoms.\n",
            "3. **Dietary Evaluation:** Consider a dietary evaluation to ensure that the current food choices are not aggravating the respiratory issue.\n",
            "4. **Medication Review:** Review the current medications for potential interactions or side effects that could contribute to the coughing.\n",
            "\n",
            "By focusing on these next steps, we aim to uncover the root cause of Jax Miracle's respiratory symptoms and provide targeted treatment to improve his overall well-being.\n",
