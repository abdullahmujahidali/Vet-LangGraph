            "1. **Endocrine System:**\n",
            "   - Luna has been diagnosed with moderate hyperthyroidism, indicated by elevated T4 levels. She is currently managed with Methimazole 2.5mg BID. Regular monitoring of thyroid levels is essential to assess treatment efficacy and adjust medication as needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Urinary System:**\n",
            "   - Luna had a history of UTI in 2022, which was successfully treated. While no current urinary issues are reported, monitoring for any recurrence or signs of renal involvement is crucial, especially given her increased thirst and urination.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Digestive System:**\n",
            "   - Luna underwent dental cleaning and extraction in 2023, resolving her dental disease. Dental health should be maintained through regular check-ups to prevent future issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Active Problems:**\n",
            "   - Luna's primary concern is hyperthyroidism, which requires ongoing management and monitoring.\n",
            "   - Weight loss, increased thirst, urination, occasional vomiting, and vocalization at night are secondary issues that may be linked to her hyperthyroidism or indicate other underlying conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Progression Status:**\n",
            "   - Luna's hyperthyroidism is being managed with Methimazole, but her weight loss and urinary symptoms require further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.\n",
            "   - Monitoring Luna's symptoms, especially her weight, thirst, and urination patterns, is essential to assess disease progression and treatment response.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Medication Dosing:**\n",
            "   - Luna's Methimazole dosage of 2.5mg BID is appropriate for her hyperthyroidism. Compliance with medication administration is crucial for effective management.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Additional Considerations:**\n",
            "   - Luna's multifactorial symptoms necessitate a comprehensive approach to her care, considering potential interactions between her conditions.\n",
            "   - Financial constraints should be taken into account when recommending diagnostic tests or treatment options to ensure feasible care for Luna.\n",
            "   - Luna's preference for pill medications should be accommodated in future prescriptions to promote compliance.\n",

            "Luna, a 13-year-old female spayed Domestic Shorthair cat, presents with weight loss, increased thirst and urination, occasional vomiting, and vocalization at night. The primary diagnosis of moderate hyperthyroidism (T4: 62 nmol/L) is being managed with Methimazole 2.5mg BID. The secondary symptoms are likely related to hyperthyroidism, with weight loss potentially being the most prominent manifestation. The increased thirst and urination could also be linked to hyperthyroidism or indicate renal involvement. Occasional vomiting may be a secondary effect of hyperthyroidism or a separate issue. Vocalization at night may be behavioral or related to medical conditions. Luna's history of dental disease and UTI in 2022 have been resolved. Ongoing monitoring and further evaluation are recommended to address the secondary symptoms and ensure comprehensive care.\n",

            "**Recommended Next Steps:**\n",
            "1. Monitor Luna's response to Methimazole for hyperthyroidism and adjust dosage as needed.\n",
            "2. Conduct further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of weight loss and address any potential renal involvement.\n",
            "3. Monitor Luna's symptoms closely, especially her weight, thirst, and urination patterns, to track disease progression.\n",
            "4. Consider additional diagnostics or treatments based on Luna's response and symptom progression.\n",

            "   - Test results for renal function (BUN, Creatinine, proteinuria) and thyroid levels (T4) support the current diagnoses.\n",
            "   - Breed-specific issues should be considered, especially for age-related concerns in older cats.\n",
