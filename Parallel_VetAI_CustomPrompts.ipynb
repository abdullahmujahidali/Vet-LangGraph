            "SPECIALIST CONSULTATION:\n",
            "1. Case Summary:\n",
            "   - A 5-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair cat presented with a 3-month history of progressive lethargy, decreased appetite, weight loss, and intermittent vomiting.\n",
            "   - Previous treatments included a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics without improvement.\n",
            "   - Diagnostic results include CBC, chemistry panel, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) testing, abdominal ultrasound, and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of a splenic mass.\n",
            "   - The clinical progression has shown worsening clinical signs despite initial treatment.\n",
            "   - Current status assessment reveals anemia, leukocytosis, hyperglobulinemia, and a palpable abdominal mass.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Disease Process Analysis:\n",
            "   - The cat is suspected to have a splenic tumor based on cytology results.\n",
            "   - Pathophysiology involves the presence of abnormal cells within the spleen leading to clinical signs such as anemia and weight loss.\n",
            "   - The disease is currently at an advanced stage as evidenced by the presence of mass and systemic effects like anemia and hyperglobulinemia.\n",
            "   - Complicating factors may include metastasis to other organs and potential compromises in organ function.\n",
            "   - Prognosis is guarded given the advanced stage of disease and potential for metastasis.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Treatment Analysis:\n",
            "   - Previous treatments with antibiotics did not address the underlying cause and resulted in persistent clinical signs.\n",
            "   - Current treatment involves supportive care and may not be effectively targeting the primary disease process.\n",
            "   - Compliance with treatment and follow-up visits appears adequate.\n",
            "   - Risk-benefit analysis suggests the need for a more aggressive treatment approach to address the suspected splenic tumor.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Specialist Recommendations:\n",
            "   - Surgical removal of the splenic mass for definitive diagnosis and potential cure.\n",
            "   - Rationale: Surgical excision allows for histopathological evaluation, staging, and potential cure if the tumor is localized.\n",
            "   - Expected outcome: Confirmation of diagnosis, determination of tumor type, staging, and potential resolution of clinical signs if the tumor is resectable.\n",
            "   - Monitoring parameters: Post-operative recovery, histopathology results, clinical signs resolution.\n",
            "   - Alternative options: Chemotherapy, radiation therapy if surgery is not feasible.\n",
            "\n",
            "COMPREHENSIVE PLAN:\n",
            "1. Medical Management:\n",
            "   - Meloxicam 0.05 mg/kg orally once daily for 5 days post-operatively for pain management.\n",
            "   - Sucralfate 20 mg/kg orally every 8 hours for 10 days post-operatively to protect the gastrointestinal tract.\n",
            "   - Antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 12.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours for 7 days post-operatively to prevent surgical site infection.\n",
            "   - Monitoring for wound healing, pain control, and gastrointestinal side effects.\n",
            "   - Duration of therapy: 5 days for pain management, 10 days for gastroprotection, 7 days for antibiotics.\n",
            "   - Modification triggers: Worsening pain, gastrointestinal upset, signs of infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Monitoring Protocol:\n",
            "   - Post-operative monitoring for pain, wound healing, appetite, and activity level daily for the first week, then weekly for 4 weeks.\n",
            "   - Target values: Absence of pain, normal wound healing, return of appetite and activity.\n",
            "   - Acceptable ranges: Pain score <3/10, mild inflammation at the surgical site.\n",
            "   - Action thresholds: Pain score >5/10, presence of wound complications.\n",
            "   - Response protocols: Adjustment of pain management, wound care interventions as needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Client Education:\n",

            "   - Instructions on monitoring for pain, wound healing, appetite, and activity level at home.\n",
            "   - Warning signs to watch for including increased pain, redness or discharge from the surgical site, decreased appetite, vomiting, or lethargy.\n",
            "   - Emergency protocols in case of severe pain, excessive bleeding, or signs of infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Follow-up Schedule:\n",
            "   - Post-operative recheck at 2 weeks for wound assessment, suture removal, and discomfort evaluation.\n",
            "   - Biopsy results review at 3 weeks to determine further treatment options based on tumor type.\n",
            "   - Additional follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first year for monitoring of tumor recurrence, metastasis, and overall health status.\n",
            "   - Long-term monitoring plan includes regular physical exams, bloodwork every 6 months, and abdominal ultrasound annually for tumor surveillance.\n",
            "   - Quality of life assessment to be discussed at each follow-up visit to ensure the cat's well-being.\n",
